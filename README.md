# sklearn_reg

The goal is to write an sklearn interface that works with all possible kernels and representations
from the QML-Code (available at https://github.com/qmlcode)

This makes it easier to use a lot of skleans' functions, so you avoid for 
example having to write your own cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization. sklearn will 
do that
